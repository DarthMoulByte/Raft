Dependency Management
+ Build and Install CMAKE/Git Projects
+ Build and install Raft/Git Project
+ Install the Raft Project's Dependencies
- Deduplicate dependencies

Build
+ Configure and Build Project Dependencies
+ Configure and Build the project
- Should support an Android build

Command Line
+ The default command should instruct the user how to use raft.
+ There should be a build option that builds the project for the host platform.
+ There should be a create option that creates a new project in the current directory.
- The create command should have an optional project source.
- The build option should have platform and architecture options.

Run
- Run the main target
- Run unit tests for the project

Package
- Package project into a distributable for the platform

Template
+ Allow using template directories
+ Allow creating a game from a template to be machine agnostic

Usability
- Write process stdout and stderr to files on failure
- Clean up / beautify the log output
- Check for all required programs before starting build
- Show progress bars for the status of each dependency

CMake
+ include ${RAFT} to pull let raft configure the build
- Create raft module and add it to CMAKE_PATH
- Allow for linking Whole libraries
- Support targeting Android build

Android Build
+ Figure out project situation (The Android project will be part of the template)
+ Needs to output dependencies in Android/<architecture>
+ Need to respect the build Android platform option
+ Update Toolchain file so that it looks for dependencies in the correct folder
- Need RaftCLI to correctly parse the -p flag
- Need a way to pass CMake options through to the dependency (Use this to supress JsonCPP tests)
- Need a way to apply patches to a dependency (Patch SFML so it installs libs and extlibs in the right place)
- Need to add Android project to the template game

Android Problems
- SFML overrides the install directory (Need to provide patch support or fork)
- JSONCPP likes to run its test (Need to set an option to prevent the test)
- Need a way to specify a certain tag or branch
- Don't link the executable during the first build
- SFML adds its own platform sub directory
- Need to specify the correct library in the manifest meta-data (sfml.app.lib-name)
- Need libgnustl_shared and libopenal.so
